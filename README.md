# PearsonAirport
An app used to show the latest departure time of Pearson Airport using RapidAPi

Purpose of this project is to broaden my understanding of back-end specifically working with data that was sent from back-end.
This project is a stepping stone to a much greater project in the the near future.


# INSTALL AND RUN
Npm install - to install all the dependencies
Will need to sign-up on rapidAPI for your unique key which will be placed "process.env.RAPID_API_KEY," in the server.js file

# Note
The app will only show the first 6 departure time of Pearson Aiport, if you wish for more remove/adjust the response data to your needs.
